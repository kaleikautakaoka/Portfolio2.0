## Acceptance Criteria
```md
WHEN I open this app
THEN I am presented with the "About Me" page

WHEN I click on the links
THEN I am presented with pages for the portfolio, resume, and contact
WHEN I visit the contact page
THEN I am able to enter my information
This would include:
-	Name
-	Email
-	Message

```
## Challenges
- Frontend Components
- I created this repo twice because I wanted to try to use a different method to create the portfolio. I was able to get the portfolio to render but I was not able to get the images to render. I was able to get the images to render on the first repo but I was not able to get the portfolio to render. I decided to go with the repo that rendered the portfolio. I will continue to work on the repo that renders the images.

## Future Enhancements
- Add additional styling
- Add additional pages
